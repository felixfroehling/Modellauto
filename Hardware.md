# Hardware and Electric Components

In this document I will give an overview of the used hardware components.

## System Block Diagram
For better understanding i made a system block diagram to show how the components are connected to each other.

## Chassis

As basis i use a RC-Buggy chassis where replaced the combustion engine with a electric engine.
The steering is controlled by a servomotor.

## MCP2515 CAN Module
For the communication between the Raspberry Pi and the Motorcontroller we need the MCP2515 Can module.
This module is necessary because the Raspberry Pi has no CAN communication and the Motorcontroller is controlled by CAN messages.
