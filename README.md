##Overview
#Hardware
The modelcar is build around a raspberry Pi 4 with Raspbian as operating system.
As chassis i used an old RC buggy and replaced the combustion engine with an electric motor.
The electric motor has a seperate controller which communicate via CAN bus with the raspberry Pi.
In the front i added two ultrasonic distance sensors and a Picamera.
Additionally to this, a Display with 5 buttons is mounted on the top for live informations.
#Software
For the software i use the Robot Operating System as Framework, so i can 


# TODO
- Battery supply of the engine
- Finish Startup menu on the display
- first field test
- follow the line project with the camera

# Done
- Next step, write python program to control the car with a gaming controller (Done, see Software/ROS-Nodes/gamecontroller_input.py)
- Image processing with python, so the car can follow a black line
- connect a display to Raspberry Pi (UART connection) (Done, See Software/ROS-Nodes/display_uart.py)
